        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>Experienced in Javascript, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS and Data visualization using Tableau. 
          I have led the front end development of an android based healthcare app called Wired Mothers 
          for The Ministry of Health of Zanzibar. Even though my most recent experience and official 
          title is of the aviation industry, I mostly worked with data as a reliability engineer to 
          identify trends and try to predict failures before they occur, saving time, money and 
          resources using data analytics techniques and tools. With that being said, programming is 
          my career of choice.</p>
